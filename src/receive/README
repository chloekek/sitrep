The overall design of the receiver consists of two types of components:
protocols and sinks.

For each supported protocol there is some server code that accepts packets
and forwards them to a sink. Packets are forwarded exactly as they come in.
They are still signed and encrypted. Authentication and encryption may
handled by the other end of the sinks.

A sink is an output range.
